1. Describe your implementation of the stack machine in a single short
   paragraph.

I created a singly linked list with inherited class instances. Pushing to the stack was peformed
by linking the old top to a new node and pointing to the new node for the top of the resulting
stack. Popping was the opposite: I would assign the top pointer to the next node pointed to by the
old top allowing the dereferenced old top to be removed from memory by the garbage collector.

2. List 3 things that you like about the Cool programming language.

It is really fun to program in because it is purely object oriented
I enjoy the simplicity of the language (very few built in functions) and it was easy to learn because of it
I like the ability to do runtime type checking (which is not built into C++)

3. List 3 things you DON'T like about Cool.

The if statements are clunky (the need for som many nested ifs and fis)
The need for additional braces for code blocks to execute sequential code
I couldn't figure out the constructor usage pattern (if there were any)
